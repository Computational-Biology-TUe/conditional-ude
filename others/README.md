# Other examples of conditional UDE applications
This folder contains some other examples of the application of conditional UDEs. The examples in this folder are explained here.

## Lotka-Volterra
In this example, we perform the Julia SciML standard example; deriving the interaction terms in a lotka-volterra system, but on 16 populations with variable interaction terms at the same time. Furthermore, this example shows the process of selecting the amount of conditional parameters.
